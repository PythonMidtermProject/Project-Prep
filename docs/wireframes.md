      - Scraper should send images to bot 
      - Scraper should search based off user input


## Stretch Goal
- Good looking front end 
- Nested AI images
- Store responses from user input in database as key value pair so as to not duplicate
- Add on user input to existing response 
- Web scraper takes in more than just images
