# Pitch Ideas

## Brainstorming Ideas
  * Create posts based on single keyword
  * Binance trading
  * Community voting platform
  * Anti Echo chamber
  * Takes in a word, scours the net and returns a picture
  * Music recommendation

## Pitch: `Community voting platform`

### Summary of idea
A single-page application that displays the top 3-5 current issues that a community needs to vote on.  Next to each issue, the app displays the top 3-5 arguments in favor and against.  Community members can vote one way or another within the voting window.

### Problem Domain
Provides a structured environment for community members to directly debate, vote, and decide on important issues.  Unlike the current system, where an individual or a group tends to control the agenda, this platform allows all community members an equal voice.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
* A single-page application
* Displays to 3-5 issues
* Next to each issue, the app displays the top 3-5 arguments in favor and against.
* Arguments in favor or against only accept votes, which will display them rank higher/lower
  * It only accepts proposals in the form of new arguments
  * How do new arguments get visibility into an ongoing debate, given that new arguments have zero votes and therefore would be displayed at the bottom -where no one looks?
  * To minimize ‘gaming the system’, only those in favor of an argument can post on the favor side and vice versa
  * Arguments have a limit of [140] characters?
