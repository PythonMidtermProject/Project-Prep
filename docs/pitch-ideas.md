# Pitch Ideas

## Brainstorming Ideas
  * Create posts based on single keyword
  * Binance trading
  * Community voting platform
  * Anti Echo chamber
  * Takes in a word, scours the net and returns a picture
  * Music recommendation

## Pitch: `Community voting platform`

### Summary of idea
A single-page application that displays the top 3-5 current issues that a community needs to vote on.  Next to each issue, the app displays the top 3-5 arguments in favor and against.  Community members can vote one way or another within the voting window.

### Problem Domain
Provides a structured environment for community members to directly debate, vote, and decide on important issues.  Unlike the current system, where an individual or a group tends to control the agenda, this platform allows all community members an equal voice.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
* A single-page application
* Displays to 3-5 issues
* Next to each issue, the app displays the top 3-5 arguments in favor and against.
* Arguments in favor or against only accept votes, which will display them rank higher/lower
  * It only accepts proposals in the form of new arguments
  * How do new arguments get visibility into an ongoing debate, given that new arguments have zero votes and therefore would be displayed at the bottom -where no one looks?
  * To minimize ‘gaming the system’, only those in favor of an argument can post on the favor side and vice versa
  * Arguments have a limit of [140] characters?

## Pitch: `AI Image Generator`

### Summary of idea
An AI with the ability to generate an image from a single or multi word input by scouring the web and recreating something new from the results.

### Problem Domain
Helps bridge the gap between AI and art to bring a more creative understanding of machine learning to users that might not have previously viewed AI as an artistic outlet or inspirational tool with the potential to revolutionalize the arts as we know them.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
A program that generates a list of images based on user input.
